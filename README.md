# Matilda
Matilda is a telegram bot written in Python 3 to scrape news articles, written in order to allow me to get a better understanding of Python. This bot is purely for educational purposes.

Matilda is currently still in the development stage. Currently, I only have time to work on Matilda on the weekends, so development for this bot might be a little slow.

## How does Matilda work?
If you have the article url, you can simply run /st or /cna <article url>

If not, you can use the search feature, to either search for specific keywords that appear in the article title, or to get the latest 5 articles.

The reason why only 5 articles are supported is because the sample version of this bot is not running on a very powerful server, and I do not wish to overload it.

From there, you can then use the inline buttons generated by the bot to read the article from the comfort of your telegram chat.

## Usage
Install the following python libraries
* python-telegram-bot
* Beautiful Soup 4
* Requests
* Python String Utilities
* dateutil
* PyMySQL


Setup a MySQL Database. 
![exampledb](/examples/dbschema_matilda.png)

Run the scripts found in the [Matilda-tools](https://github.com/xlanor/matilda-tools) folder. More information is avaliable there. This will enable you to grab new articles as they come out.

Update token.py with your bot's api token, mysql information, and the list of user ids for admin.


Start your bot with 
```bash
python3 matilda.py
```


If you are running Matilda on linux, you may also want to use this command to ensure that Matilda keeps running after you exit the terminal.

```bash
sudo nohup python3 matilda.py > /home/matilda-live/error.log 2>&1 &
```
